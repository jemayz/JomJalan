<h1 align="center">JomJalan – AI Smart Travel App</h1>


**JomJalan** is an intelligent, all-in-one travel app designed to solve information overload for travelers in Malaysia. Instead of switching between Google, TikTok, and Instagram, JomJalan scrapes real-time social trends to find the hottest spots and then uses AI to build a personalized itinerary based on user **budget** and **interests**.
